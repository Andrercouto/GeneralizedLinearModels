# Simple and Multiple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to the data. The goal of simple linear regression is to find the line of best fit that describes the relationship between the predictor variable (independent variable) and the response variable (dependent variable). This line can then be used to make predictions about the response variable based on the value of the predictor variable.

Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression that allows for modeling the relationship between more than one predictor variable and the response variable. In multiple linear regression, the goal is to find the line of best fit that describes the relationship between the response variable and multiple predictor variables. This line can then be used to make predictions about the response variable based on the values of the predictor variables.

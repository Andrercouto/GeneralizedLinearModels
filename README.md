# Generalized Linear Models

Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are a class of regression models that are widely used in statistics and machine learning for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. GLMs are a generalization of linear regression models, and they are designed to handle a wider range of response variables, including binary, count, and categorical variables.

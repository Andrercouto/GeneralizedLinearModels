# Linear Models for Count Data

Linear models for count data are a class of statistical models used for analyzing count data, in which the response variable is a non-negative integer. These models are used to predict or explain the relationship between the count response variable and the explanatory variables. There are different types of linear models for count data, including Poisson models, negative binomial models, and zero-inflated count models.

# Linear Models for Count Data

Linear models for count data are a class of statistical models used for analyzing count data, in which the response variable is a non-negative integer. These models are used to predict or explain the relationship between the count response variable and the explanatory variables. There are different types of linear models for count data, including Poisson models, negative binomial models, and zero-inflated count models.

### Poisson Model

The Poisson model is the simplest and most common. It assumes that the response variable follows a Poisson distribution, where the mean is equal to the variance. It is suitable when the count is rare, i.e., the count mean is low relative to the sample size, and when the explanatory variables have an additive effect on the count. The formula for the Poisson model is given by:

$log(y_i) = {\alpha} + {\beta}1 x{1i} + {\beta}2 x{2i} + ... + {\beta}k x{ki} $

where $y_i$ is the mean count for the i-th observation, $xi$ is the vector of explanatory variable values for the i-th observation, and ${\alpha}$, ${\beta}1$, ${\beta}2$, ..., ${\beta}k$ are the model parameters.


In a Poisson regression model, the log-likelihood function is used to estimate the model parameters. The log-likelihood function for a Poisson model with n observations and p predictors is given by:

$loglikehood = ∑(y_i log(μ_i) - μ_i - log(y_i!))$

 The predicted mean count $μ_i$ is calculated as:
 
 $ μi ={\alpha} + {\beta}1 x{1i} + {\beta}2 x{2i} + ... + {\beta}k x{ki} $
